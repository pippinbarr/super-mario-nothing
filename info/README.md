## Description

*Get ready to not jump on Goombas! Under a cloudless sky! Because there is no sky! Because there isn't anything! Enjoy your time off!*

*Super Mario Nothing* is kind of a ROM hack of *Super Mario Bros.* for the NES. Except the hack is to delete everything while making sure the game still runs. There are two versions available. The (D) version (for *D*eleted) is a *Super Mario Bros.* ROM where all the data has been removed. The (Z) version (for *Z*eroed) is a *Super Mario Bros.* ROM where all the data has been zeroed out. Why? Because I needed an easy project, give me a break. Also I think it's a way to think about destruction as creation, the copyright status of erased data, the relationships between process and outcome, and *stuff like that*.

*Super Mario Nothing* was created using VS Code to edit the hex code in a ROM of *Super Mario Bros.*. I referred to the [NesDev.org wiki](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/INES) for an explanation of the header information in NES ROMs.

Would I like to make an actual cartridge version of this game? Yes I would.
